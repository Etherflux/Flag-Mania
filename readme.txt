Flag Mania
by Zyenapz

Game Version: 2.0
Python Version: 3.7.0
Tested on: Windows 10

How to run the game
    (i) Make sure you have Python 3 installed
    (ii) Run 'FlagMania.pyw'
    (iii) If you want to wipe the highscore list, then simply delete all the content within the 'highscores.txt' file
        (iiia) I might add a wipe high score list function in the future, though I highly doubt that I will since I don't want users to have control over it.

Objectives
    (i) Try to score as high as possible under 60 seconds!

Notes
    Flag Mania! Guess the flag right, and gain a score, but if you guess wrong, then you'll lose a score! It's simple, really. I might add a 'hardcore' game mode in the future where you instantly lose if you guess wrong.
    I like vexillology - hell, this game was originally called vexill.io - so I made this simple game. Some of the coding solution is a bit lazy but I'm going to fix that real soon, as well as making my own assets.
